For this mini-project, I'll deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it. The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned. 

I'll be using the browser's developer tools and building the page in a .html text file that'll be opened in the browser to check it out.

Reflections from this project: /* To be posted at the en of it */
